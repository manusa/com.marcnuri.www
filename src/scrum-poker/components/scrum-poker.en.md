## About

[Planning Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_poker), 
a.k.a. Scrum Poker, is a consensus based technique to estimate and plan development
goals in agile teams.

In a typical Scrum Poker session, members of the team make estimates by playing cards upside down
instead of saying them out loud. When all members have their estimates ready, cards are revealed
all at once and estimates are then discussed amongst the members of the Agile team.

## Scrum Poker App

This is an online version of the estimation cards deck.

### How to play

1. Pick a card from the deck
2. Show the flipped card to the group
3. Once all of the estimations are ready, shake your phone/device to reveal your card
4. Tap on the card to start again

### Devices not supporting device motion events

It's possible your device doesn't support the HTML 5 feature used to detect if it is moving. In
that case, simply click/tap on the flipped card to reveal its value.
