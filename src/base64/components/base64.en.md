## What is Base64 encoder/decoder?
This is an online tool to encode into and decode from Base64.

Base64 is a binary-to-text encoding scheme commonly used to transport binary data across communication
channels that only support text content. This ensures that data remains intact during transportation
or storage through these channels.

### How to encode data into Base64?
Paste the data you want to encode into the Input field and press the Encode button.
The result Base64 encoded string will be available in the Output field. 

### How to decode data from Base64?
Paste the text you want to decode into the Input field and press the Decode button.
The decoded data will be available in the Output field.
