I'm a software developer based in Valencia, Spain.
I have a passion for building web applications, and I've been professionally doing so for more than
15 years.

I'm currently working as a Principal software engineer for Red Hat. I'm part of the team maintaining two
great free open source projects,
[Eclipse JKube](https://github.com/eclipse/jkube "Kubernetes Maven and Gradle plugins for Java") and 
[Fabric8 Kubernetes Client](https://github.com/fabric8io/kubernetes-client "Kubernetes Java Client").

When I'm not coding, I like to spend time with my family and friends. You may also find me running 
freely in the mountains.
